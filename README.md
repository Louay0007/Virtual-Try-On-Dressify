# Virtual Try-On Diffusion [VTON-D] by IEEE ISSATM

Virtual Try-On Diffusion [VTON-D] by ISSATM is a custom diffusion-based pipeline for fast 
and flexible multi-modal virtual try-on. Clothing, avatar and background can be specified by reference images or text 
prompts allowing for clothing transfer, avatar replacement, fashion image generation and other virtual try-on related 
tasks.
